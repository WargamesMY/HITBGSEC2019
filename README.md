#### *Rules*

```text
We try hard to keep the competition as free and exciting as possible; however, we do require teams to adhere to a few simple rules:

1. Show up in time or you'll miss the briefing.
2. No off-the-shelf automated scanning tools such as Nessus, OpenVAS, etc. It's useless and we'll kick you out for that lame ass shit.
3. No cooperation between teams with independent accounts. Sharing of flags or providing revealing hints to other teams is cheating, don't do it.
4. No attacking the competition infrastructure. If bugs or vulns are found, please alert the competition organizers immediately
5. Absolutely no sabotaging of other competing teams, or in any way hindering their independent progress.
6. No brute forcing of challenge flag / keys against the scoring server
7. No flooding and / or DoS attacks. Teams caught in the act will be penalized by a time penalty or a disqualification.
8. No ARP spoofing. Teams caught in the act will be penalized by a time penalty or a disqualification.
9. No physical attacks against other players.
10. All participants must obey to PIT STOP calls. PIT STOP calls are rest intervals where all the players must leave the CTF area to facilitate for the CTF Crew to perform maintenance work.
10. The rules and regulations will or might be updated without prior notice.
11. At all times, the decision of the HITB and WGMY Crew is final on any matter in question.
